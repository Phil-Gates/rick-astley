# rick
A script-kiddie "virus" I made as my first project in the C programming language. This runs on Linux with the bash shell. (not tested)

# Features
 - [x] Changes `$HOME` and `$PATH` variables so common commands run result in a rickroll
 - [x] Makes a hidden copy of itself on the system
 - [x] Injects code into most shell files, which runs the hidden version
 - [ ] Overwrites ELF files, but saves copies in a directory
 - [ ] Adds itself to .tar archives
 - [x] Fun graphical payload
